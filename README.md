ECE382_Lab1-A simple assembly language calculator
=================================================

## Objectives and Purpose
The object of Lab 1 is to create a simple assembly language calculator that reads a series of instructions,
performs the desired operations, and stores the result to memory. The required functionality includes:
  *ADD_OP - 0x11
  *SUB_OP - 0x22
  *CLR_OP - 0x44
  *END_OP - 0x55
  
Additionally, Lab 1 will also be able to perform:
  *Setting results to a maximum of 255 and a minimum of 0 when they exceed those bounds
  *MUL_OP - 0x33 
  
## Implementation Plan
Coming Soon!
